# PokedexProject
Winform Project
Always been a huge pokemon fan so I wanted to create a pokdex that would display the sounds and pokemon sprites. 
I created a sql database to store the information for all the pokemon. The images and sprites were downloaded from a third party and stored in local folders
I just made copy and pasted the local file path to the column in the sql server so that I could retrive them
The project utilized a DLL and an EDM
